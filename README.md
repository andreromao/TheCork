# The Cork - Group 25

TheCork is a service that allows its users to make restaurant reservations via a mobile application and website that integrates seamlessly with the restaurants' calendars.

Customers can see which restaurants are available and book a table in a mobile app. They can also do these commands on a website. 
Restaurants also have a platform where they can manage their schedule and approve or deny clients’ reservations. 

The system also has a discount card service provider, that allows customers to use their card points in order to have discounts in their bookings.
